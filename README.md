# FSBL-definitions

Definitions for the FSBL object

**Instructions for use:**

You can either import or reference the types from the seed project or add them to the root file of @chartiq/finsemble in the node_modules.
If you follow the node_modules @chartiq/finsemble option you can use it like so:

`/// <reference types="@chartiq/finsemble" />`

OR

`import { FSBL, WindowIdentifier } from "@chartiq/finsemble";`

If you choose to reference from the seed project you will need to change the references above to match the path of the FSBL-definitions folder.
